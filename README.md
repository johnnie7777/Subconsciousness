# Subconsciousness
Have you ever wondered what happens to your mind when you sleep or when you're not paying attention?
What influence do the everyday aspects of life have on the hidden corners of your brain?
Or do elements appear in your dreams that seem nonsensical at first, but make perfect sense once you reflect on them?
All of this is the subconscious.

It's not just an ordinary game — the game is you, and the darkest corners of your mind, even if you don’t want to admit it.
